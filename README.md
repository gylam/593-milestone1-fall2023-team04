# MADS Milestone1 Fall 2023

This project was completed for Milestone 1 as part of the University of Michigan Masters of Applied Data Science (MADS) program in fall 2023. Our project goal was to examine potential relationships between health measures and predominant industries in US counties. Using publicly-available data, we generated several visualizations including histograms, heatmaps, and a parallel coordinate plot. We found weak correlations between the top industries in a county and health measures.
